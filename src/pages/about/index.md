### Megan

![Young Megan](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/c_crop,g_custom,h_1300,w_1300/v1581202773/about/11709959_10206936781725599_3523722717878405974_o_i9zlwj.jpg) Born into a family of public servants and raised in Ohio, Megan's career has been devoted to fighting for environmental protection, political progress, and puppies.

With some B.S. in zoology from OSU, Megan is a burgeoning urban farmer, working a 3,500 sq ft plot of vegetables and native flora while caring for  six chickens, two dogs, and — quite by accident — one turkey who just won't leave. 

A veteran of political campaigns and environmental advocacy work, Megan is self-employed as a consultant and aspiring farmer.

Megan has yet to enjoy the taste of victory, but there's always a first time.

### JC

![Young JC](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/v1581202773/about/Drum_Flag_JC_qheqv1.jpg) A native of Little Canada, MN, JC didn't visit big Canada until 2013.

The youngest of his father's 11 children and the oldest of his mother's 1 child, JC grew up in a political family. His father was a state representative and his mother worked for the Minnesota DFL. They introduced JC to politics at a young age, taking him to a Mondale/Ferraro rally in '84 and committing many, many instances of voter fraud because he liked to pull the levers in the voting booths.

JC went to college for computer science, and realized he preferred politics; upon graduation he started working in politics and immediately realized they didn't know how to use computers. He's worked at the nexus of politics, government, and technology ever since, since he can tell a good thing when he sees it (this is also why he signed onto this ticket).

To date, JC's only successful campaign involved an eight-month recount.

### Stronger Together

Megan and JC have been on the campaign trail together for seven years, traveling the country from the swamps of Washington, D.C. to "The Bubble" in Berkeley, CA.

They have assembled a great team along the way including Annie (a newcomer, but with the requisite hunger) and Radar, a fiercely loyal and experienced politico.

Despite their mediocre win-loss ratio, Megan and JC are confident that, together, victory is guaranteed. Especially if it involves spending an inordinate amount of time at the Minnesota State Fair.
