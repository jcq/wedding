##### But why are you getting married on a farm? Are there going to be animals?

Because we love farms! Sadly (or fortunately?), there are no animals out of respect to guests with allergies or who don't want to smell pigs while they eat. Yes, that was a feature of Megan's preferred venue.

##### What else is happening this weekend?

You could check out the *Vikings Begin* exhibition at the American Swedish Institute. Or, hang out with us (even more) Friday and/or Sunday! Check out the Events page [here](https://miragliaquirin2020.com/events).

##### Can I bring kids?

Yes! Preferably yours.

##### What should I wear?

Please dress how you feel most comfortable. “Wedding Casual” is appropriate if you like a dress code. We will be on and off grass, so keep this in mind for shoes.

##### What will the weather be like?

After extensive research into local meteorological data, we can report the following:

* August in St. Paul typically sees temperatures ranging from 61º F to 79º F. It does get a bit *moist*, with 74% average humidity.
* Volgograd, Russia (5,485 mi away) and Benxi, China (6,058 mi away) are the farthest locations with temperatures most similar to the Twin Cities.

The reception will take place in an historic barn without sophisticated climate control, so it may be hot/humid during the day and chilly at night.

##### What if I’m worried about my food allergy or dietary restrictions?

Please let us know your needs so we can make sure you are both safe and sated!

##### How do I get to Minnesota? Is it the same as Wisconsin? Where should I stay?

Minnesota is technically a different state than Wisconsin, but just barely. Please find this information (and more!) [here](https://miragliaquirin2020.com/get-involved).

##### Do I need to RSVP?

Yes, please! [RSVP by July 15 here.](https://miragliaquirin2020.com/rsvp/)

##### Where can I play pickleball?

If Kathleen tricks you into leaving the celebration for a pickleball match, it is a trap. However, there are nice courts at Tanners Lake Park in Oakdale, a mere 16 minutes away!
