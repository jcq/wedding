##### But why are you getting married on a farm? Are there going to be animals?

Because we love farms! Sadly (or fortunately?), there are no animals out of respect to guests with allergies or who don't want to smell pigs while they eat. Yes, that was a feature of Megan's preferred venue.

##### What else is happening this weekend?

You could check out the *Vikings Begin* exhibition at the American Swedish Institute. Or, hang out with us (even more) Friday and/or Sunday! Check out the Events page [here](https://miragliaquirin2020.com/events).

##### Can I bring kids?

Yes! Preferably yours.

##### What should I wear?

Please dress however you are most comfortable! “Wedding Casual”, if you need something official. We will be on and off grass, so consider this when making shoe decisions.

##### What will the weather be like?

After extensive research into local meteorological data, we can report the following:

* June 12 typically sees temperatures ranging from 62º F to 77º F, with a 41% chance of some type of precipitation.
* Volgograd, Russia (5,485 mi away) and Benxi, China (6,058 mi away) are the farthest locations with temperatures most similar to the Twin Cities.

The reception will take place in an historic barn without sophisticated climate control, so please plan accordingly.

##### What if I’m worried about my food allergy or dietary restrictions?

We are trying to be inclusive, but please let us know your needs so we can make sure you are safe and sated!

##### How do I get to Minnesota? Is it the same as Wisconsin? Where should I stay?

Minnesota is technically a different state than Wisconsin, but just barely. Please find this information (and more!) [here](https://miragliaquirin2020.com/get-involved).

##### Do I need to RSVP?

That would be nice. But don't worry about it until 2021.

##### Where can I play pickleball?

If Kathleen tricks you into leaving the celebration for a pickleball match, it is a trap. However, there are nice courts at Tanners Lake Park in Oakdale, a mere 16 minutes away!

*If you have any other questions, please reach out to either JC or Megan, or email [MiragliaQuirin2020@gmail.com](mailto:MiragliaQuirin2020@gmail.com)*
