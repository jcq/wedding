    You may recognize **Minneapolis** from the news, but unlike what you might
    have seen there, it's actually the City of Lakes, not fire. It's a vibrant
    and fun city, with a dense downtown, lots of great restaurant options,
    attractions, and popular neighborhoods. Expect city traffic and parking.


    **St. Paul** is quieter and less bustling, with plenty of great restaurants,
    but not the same city scene. While both cities have river access, those in
    St. Paul tout its better view and the beautiful capitol building. (And you
    can guess where loyalty lies here.)

    We will have two hotel room blocks available: one in downtown Minneapolis

    and one in downtown Saint Paul (at [The Saint Paul
    Hotel](https://www.saintpaulhotel.com/)).


    Feel free to stay at either - or neither!

We can't wait for you to join us! ![Love Sculpture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/c_crop,g_north,h_3450,w_3024/v1581202922/get_involved/IMG_2250_kwlped.jpg)

**Minneapolisâˆ’Saint Paul International Airport ([MSP](https://www.mspairport.com/))** services the Twin Cities.

Try the [light rail](https://www.metrotransit.org/metro): take the Blue Line from the airport straight to Downtown Minneapolis, or transfer to the Green Line at historic Union Depot to Lowertown Saint Paul.

If you are looking to avoid cars, there is extensive bus service around the metro area. Check out the [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/trip-planner) website for more info.

The [venue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bruentrup+Heritage+Farm+and+the+Maplewood+Historical+Society/@45.035173,-93.0090352,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf2366bbf258a29da!8m2!3d45.035173!4d-93.0090352) is around 20 minutes (sans traffic) from Minneapolis and 10 minutes from Saint Paul by car, which is probably the best way to reach it. You can carpool, take a Lyft, or a taxi (which, yes, still exist!).

If you would like to rent a car, they can be [rented at the airport](https://www.mspairport.com/directions/ground-transportation/car-rentals).
