![JC, Megan, Cherry & Spoon](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/c_crop,g_north,h_3100,w_3024/v1581202921/get_involved/IMG_20190905_184311_v06v9u.jpg) Welcome to Minnesota!

Unfortunately, you won't be here for the [State Fair](https://www.mnstatefair.org/) and probably won't have time for a canoe trip on the Boundary Waters, but we hope you'll come back.

Here are some other things you might enjoy *(with distance from that city's hotel block in parentheses)*:

##### Minneapolis:

* **[American Swedish Institute](https://www.asimn.org/)** *(1.8 mi)*\
  Turns out Sweden is more than IKEA. Check out the history museum, culture center, and mansion
* **[Chain of Lakes](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minneapolis_chain_of_lakes_regional_park/)** *(3 mi)*\
  Do you like bodies of water but have a tough time choosing just one? Want to know why they were called the 'Minneapolis Lakers' before moving to LA? Minneapolis is called the City of Lakes for reason!
* **[Mill City Museum](https://www.mnhs.org/millcity)** *(1.5 mi)*\
  The mills ruins are stunning enough for a visit on their own. Located next to the historic [Stone Arch Bridge](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/historical_sites/stone_arch_bridge/); this is perhaps the quintessential view of the Minneapolis riverfront. And if you don't know what 'swarf' is, you might actually need to go inside
* **[Minneapolis Institute of Art](https://new.artsmia.org/)** *(1.1 mi)*\
  Free fine art museum; showed a great cuttlefish traveling exhibit one time. They probably have good stuff now too
* **[Minneapolis Sculpture Garden](https://walkerart.org/visit/garden)** *(0.9 mi)* \
  An 11-acre urban park featuring 40+ iconic sculptures including feminist think piece *Hahn/Cock*
* **[Minnehaha Falls](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/)** *(6 mi)*\
  A surprising waterfall and short trail in the middle of the city

##### St. Paul:

* **[Como Park Zoo & Conservatory](https://comofriends.org/)** *(4.8 mi)*\
  Free small indoor/outdoor zoo and conservatory
* **[Harriet Island Regional Park](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/parks-recreation/harriet-island-regional-park)** *(1 mi)*\
  Popular park and community space with paddle boats along the Mississippi River
* **[James J. Hill House](https://www.mnhs.org/hillhouse)** *(1.1 mi)*\
  Historic home completed in 1891 by railroad magnate and noted rich person James J. Hill; offering daily tours
* **[Minnesota History Center](https://www.mnhs.org/historycenter)** *(0.9 mi)*\
  Museum all about... Minnesota, including a special exhibit on Extraordinary Women
* **[Minnesota State Capitol](https://www.mnhs.org/capitol/activities)** *(1.0 mi)*\
  Designed by Cass Gilbert (who designed the U.S. Supreme Court), the Minnesota Capitol is definitively — in JC's wholly unbiased opinion — in the top tier of capitol buildings in the country
* **[Mississippi Riverwalk and Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ckZnNieWH3JLY4gg9)** *(0.3 mi)*\
  5.8 mile flat trail along the shoreline with view of trees and wildlife
* **[Science Museum of Minnesota](https://www.smm.org/)** *(0.3 mi)*\
  This place is probably more fun than we are, but you can definitely fit both in a day, plus brunch

##### Surrounding Area:

* **[Mall of America](https://www.mallofamerica.com/)** *(0.5 mi from MSP Airport)*\
  You want over 96 acres of mall? You got it. Fun fact: it was a filming location for both *D2: The Mighty Ducks* and the Schwarzenegger holiday classic, *Jingle All the Way*.
* **[Stillwater](https://www.discoverstillwater.com/)** *(20.8 mi from St Paul)*\
  30 minutes from Minneapolis and just 15 minutes from our venue, this charming town sits on the bank of the St. Croix River with walking paths, sightseeing tours, antique stores, and boating. The setting for *Grumpy Old Men*, Stillwater is also known for its lift bridge and the enormous scoops of ice cream at [Nelson's](https://www.nelsonsicecream.biz/).
* **[Fort Snelling](http://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling)** *(7.3 mi from St Paul)*\
  Fort Snelling, dating to the early 1800s, is located at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. It now features restored fortifications, and is set amongst the beauty of Fort Snelling State Park and the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge.
